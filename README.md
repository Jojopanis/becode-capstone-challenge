## Overview

The scope of this project is to summarize all the knowledge we got from our training at [BeCode](https://becode.org/) in one big project. The main objective is to get informations form a news site, cleaning and pre-processing it to feed them into a model that will cluster them based on topic modeling. And ideally, deplying the whole project online.

## Usage

## Timeline

Start of the first week - We spent some time to explore the stucture of the [rtbf website](https://www.rtbf.be/en-continu) and found a json structure to easily scrap

## Roadblocks

The first roadblock we found was the rtbf news API wich, with the method we used, limited us to the number 100. So we had to maximise the scrapping to 100 pages of 100 articles each.
